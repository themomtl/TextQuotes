# Texting Real-Time Stock Quotes

This program is designed for users who don't have internet access to get real-time stock quotes.

## Stock Price

To get stock prices, text any ticker to `lakewoodnjquotes@gmail.com`. For example, send `t` for AT&T.

## Watch Lists

To create a new watch list, text three tickers separated by slashes followed by a space and then `wl`. For example: `f/gm/tsla wl`. This will respond with the watchlist name.

To check a watchlist, text the watchlist name. For example: `wl4`.
